# Eat Da Burger

## Overview

Eat Da Burger is a Heroku based web app which allows you to perform a few basic SQL functions.

Add text to the text box shown and press submit to add a burger with the name you gave in the text box to the 'Burgers to Eat' section of the webpage. The burger appears with a button to devour it. Clicking that button moves the burger to the 'Burgers Eaten' section, and changes the button function to 'delete'. As you may imagine, clicking this button deletes the burger from the database and webpage.
